# Flight Sim Control
A cardboard joystick with throttle for GeoFs made with Arduino Nano.

## Description
This joystick and throttle are really basic and can be used to play GeoFS online flight simulator. The joystick uses an
Arduino Nano to run. The Nano sends data over to the computer that runs python code which simulates keyboard pushes and mouse
movements that interact with GeoFS. While this project is cool, the new joystick is better hardware-wise and can be configurable with any joystick-supporting flight simulator. The new joystick link can be found below â¬‡.
